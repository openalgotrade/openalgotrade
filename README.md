Basic automated trading tools to get you started with algorithmic trading. In the "Tools" folder, you'll find a C++ project (more to come?) that deals with all the socket programming of the Interactive Brokers API (thanks to a project built by Jan Boonen). This makes it easier to create simple tools such as getting market data, getting historical data, placing orders, etc.
In the "SampleAlgorithms" folder, you'll find programs written in Python that utilize the tools that connect to IB using their C++ API. 

If you would like to add more tools (maybe through another broker?) or algos, please submit a pull request!

## IB/C++ API portions of this code are built on top of the project started by Jan Boonen. [Here it is](https://github.com/JanBoonen/TwsApiCpp).

### WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES OF IMPLEMENTING THESE STRATEGIES. THEY ARE ONLY MEANT TO SERVE AS A TEMPLATE TO GET YOU STARTED IN THE WORLD OF ALGORITHMIC TRADING. THIS IS WHY WE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOU NEED TO TEST THESE AND MODIFY IN PAPER TRADING.
